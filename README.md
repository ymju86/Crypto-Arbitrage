## üìä Overview

Arbitrage is defined as the simultaneous buying and selling of currency in different platforms to take advantage of differing prices. This project provides comprehensive insights into the potential application of arbitrage strategies on cryptocurrencies through:

- **Real-time data collection** from 5 major exchanges
- **Statistical analysis** of price differences
- **Automated trading bot** implementation
- **Performance evaluation** with real trading results

## üîç Project Structure

### Data Collection & Analysis
- **800,000+ data points** collected over 2 weeks (Feb 5-19)
- **5 cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP)
- **5 exchanges**: Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, CEX.io
- **Real-time price monitoring** using public APIs
