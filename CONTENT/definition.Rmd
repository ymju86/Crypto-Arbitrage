#Definition
***
Crypto currencies are bought and sold on different `exchanges`. Basically it is like a bank, but for crypto. The price is not allways exactly the same on 2 exchanges, as shown [here](https://holtzy.github.io/Crypto-Arbitrage/CONTENT/differences.html). It is thus possible to buy a crypto where the price is low, and sell it instantly where the price is high to realize a gain without taking any risk.

Consider the following situation as an example:

- *step 1* - the price of etherum is 700 euros on Kraken (exchange 1). I take 700 euros and buy 1 Etherum
- *step 2* - I send this etherum to Bitstamp (exchange 2)
- *step 3* - I sell the etherum on Bitstamp, but the price is different: 750. Thus I now have 750 euros, which is a gain of 50 euros.
- *Again*

<br>

Here is an illustration using tomatoes, buy at 1 euro / kilo, sold at 1.1 euros / kilo. The idea is to do the same, but instantly and using crypto instead of tomatoes.

#Limitation
***
Of course the naive example described above encouters several limit in real life. Here is a list of them:

- `Price differences are rare`: you can read the dedicated page where I quantified these differences
- `Transaction have fees`: each time you buy, sell or transfer crypto, fees apply. In most of the exchanges there is a 0.25% fee to buy and sell
- `Prices evolve quickly`: buy the time you discovered a price discrepancy, prices are already different. This is called *Slippage risk*. Doing arbitrage without an automatic bot is impossible.
- `Crypto transfer takes time`: you can buy and sell crypto instantly, however it takes time to send it to another exchange or to/from your bank account
- `Concentration risk`: if it is always the same exchange that is more expensive, all your money will ends up in it. You won't be able to do any new transaction until you rebalance funds.
- `Price volatility`: let's say you have a efficient arbitrage algorithm that makes 1% a day. If the crypto price drops down when you have some, your loss will probably higher than your gains.



#The plan
***
Most of the limitations above do not have any workaround. However it is possible to change a bit the arbitrage strategy to avoid transfering funds from one exchange to another. Here is how it works:

- *step1* - crypto is cheaper on exchange 1 than on exchange 2. I buy some crypto on it.
- *step2* - in the same time, I sell exactly the same amount of crypto on exchange 2.
- *step3* - wait for a new price differences in the other side.
- *step4* - perform exactly the same think but in the other side.
- *Again*

#Litterature
***
Several methods of arbitrage exist and I'm far from being the only one trying to do it. Here is a selection of a few really promising project that are worth visiting:

- [CryptoArbitrager](http://cryptoarbitrager.com): use the fact that the evolution of different currencies are strongly correlated. Sometimes a delay is observed, what is an arbitrage opportunity.
- [Blackbird](https://github.com/butor/blackbird): has the advantage of being Market neutral: no loss if the global price of the currency drop down.
- [R2](https://github.com/bitrinjani/r2)
- [Peregrine](https://github.com/wardbradt/peregrine)



#Next step
***
The next step simulates an arbitrage algorithm on a 2 weeks period to assess the potential gain.
